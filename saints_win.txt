in the beginning was the slide from grace
and everything since then has been chaos
a neverending wave of dissolution
cascasded in a frenzy of micro lesions
rotten to the core
the dessciated fruit lingers on the vine
falling when a whisper touches it
sending me back to agony
at the whip and the absolution of frost
